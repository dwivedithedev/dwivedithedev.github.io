It started by shattering all my expectations which I had regarding various areas of life. </p>\n<p>While I can start by giving you all the updates regarding how my projects have been performing, I believe there are a couple more things we can talk about around it.</p>\n<p>In the month of January, I was in a hurry. A hurry to launch something because I wanted to. I forced myself to come up with a possibly shitty idea and make it into an informational product based on an already failed product which wasn't that helpful. That's where my mind chose the wrong road.  Now, I don't completely think of it as a failed product, it just isn't profitable in those regards. </p>\n<p>Anyhow, I still made that informational product and launched it out there. To my surprise, I did receive the support for it &#x26; I am grateful for those who helped me in supporting, however the truth is that there were no sales. It made me $2, that too after I made it pay what you want. Now that i think of it, I just built it for the sake of the \"challenge\" &#x26; to be honest, I am not the only one to blame for it. I was inspired by all the \"success stories\" of people building informational products on top of this famous creator's platform. Guess it doesn't work for every one of us. </p>\n<p>When it was February, I circled back to what seems to be going well &#x26; that was my newsletter on psychology. You know what's interesting? I never had the intention to make money out of it. It started as a newsletter to teach you psychology because I had hopped onto the substack hype-train. So, in the moment to ship something for the month, I made a landing page for it. It still doesn't make me any money though.</p>\n<p>March is when shit started getting real. I never felt my mind fucked because I found myself short on coming up with \"good\" ideas! I wanted to work on a project but I just couldn't come up with one. Numerous days &#x26; nights went into procrastinating, thinking, figuring out to get the RIGHT idea. Most of the time, I found myself stuck in analysis paralysis. </p>\n<p>You know that's the thing with us makers. You have a good idea and you are really excited to work on it. You do some research &#x26; find competition existing already. <em>Little demotivating but it's fine, you can make a slightly different version of it.</em> Mid way, you realize this idea might not make you money or you don't know who the target audience is (because everyone is not a customer) or this project is too big in complexity or yada yada and what not. This cycle messes our mind!</p>\n<p>Something along those lines happened with me until I discussed it with a friend over twitter which helped me immensely to define a correct path. I developed this new philosophy around building products which seem to make me the most sense. I might write about it if its succeeds. Almost at the end of the month, I went with the idea of The Lesson Club.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>My goal was to make $1000 in Q1 and I ended up with $22. At least it is something. </p>\n<p>I am still wondering about <a href=\"https://www.designtack.com\">Designtack</a> &#x26; <a href=\"http://www.learningin.tech\">LIT</a> in terms of what has to be done with them because they are practically dead projects. However, I would still keep them alive for what its worth.</p>\n<p>Also, I am having this urge to take a break from everything for (much needed?) mental peace. Before that, I want to write about my one year journey of going indie and building projects which will be next month.</p>\n<p>Hope you are having a better start this year, reader. </p>\n<p>That would be all from my side for now.</p>","excerpt":"This year started off on different grounds as compared to last one.
