I always feel different about it. Maybe because it is my birthday month. or maybe it is the time of the year when i feel like the end of the year is coming. It's a good thing though, right? The year of 2020 hasn't been a great one so far. Everyone thinks that by next year, the pandemic situation will start improving. It's the hope that is keeping us together.</p>\n<p>Let's talk about this month only, for now. A lot of things happened. Some were good, some were weird and some were unexpected. I want to start by sharing how my experience with Reddit went.</p>\n<p>Before that, Let me tell you that I have (again) started to build a newsletter. </p>\n<p>The newsletter is called <a href=\"https://psych.substack.com/welcome\">Psych ðŸ§ </a>. It is a bi-weekly newsletter where I share with you amusing psychological insights which can prove to be beneficial in your personal as well as professional life. </p>\n<p>Unlike Designtack, which is a product, I didn't know where &#x26; how to promote a newsletter. I did it on forums, communities, social media but that didn't seem to yield much result. Some googling led me to a post on a random website where a lot of people said that Reddit is great place if it works out. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://psych.substack.com/p/selective-perception-\">Selective Perception</a> acted in my mind and so,  I decided to post on Reddit.</p>\n<p>I found a sub-reddit called <strong>r/psychology</strong> and thought, this would be the suitable place to promote my newsletter around psychology. So, I posted a link to one of the post from the newsletter.</p>\n<p>What happened then? I got criticized for not mentioning a \"proper\" study related to the topic discussed in the newsletter, people in the comments said it's spam &#x26; the research is not true. A few appreciated it. </p>\n<p>Even though I received around 65+ upvotes, I was surprised by the comments,</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qVMrobu.png\"></p>\n<p>One thing I want to clarify is that the research discussed in the post is indeed a proven bias. There does exists a study which confirms it. I had mentioned it in the references section. </p>\n<p>Before I could reply to these people, I get a notification.</p>\n<p><strong>SOMEONE GAVE THE POST - WHOLESOME AWARD</strong> ?!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5kbVxRe.png\"></p>\n<p>Reddit is a weird place. Even though the upvotes were higher than the negative comments, the post got removed. No reason given. I could've debated with the people but they took down the post before I could even process all this.</p>\n<h2>What I learnt from this?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>I should've analyzed the pattern of the sub-reddit posts. I think it varies a lot as per subreddits. What people are appreciating in one, may not in other one.</li>\n<li>Maybe my way of promoting was wrong. I could've just posted a normal thread asking people to check out my newsletter. </li>\n<li>Luck is a probable factor here.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While I did NOT get any subscribers, I received the highest number of views on that particular post. I don't regret this but I am glad that I know (somewhat) how Reddit is.</p>\n<p>Statistically speaking, Psych currently has reached <em>30+ subscribers</em>. I am going all in the research, consistency and efforts. If you take a look at all the Newsletter posts published so far, You can see that I do cite references to necessary sources and studies. One Newsletter post takes me around 2-3 days for a proper research.</p>\n<p>It's totally free and for now, I have no plans to make money off this. </p>\n<h2>What's up with Designtack?</h2>\n<p>Things aren't going much good with it. I have contacted users and asked for feedback a lot of the times but here's the thing. People are appreciating the tool but not using it. Isn't it weird? </p>\n<p>For the users, I built a quick mode, a wizard based option where they can just enter text and website name. It generates the social media content for them automatically. I thought this could bring back users but it didn't.</p>\n<p>Except talking to users, promoting on social media, I haven't done anything special on the marketing side because a lot of the times I am feeling that I can't do anything with it. </p>\n<p>I need to start considering it as a failure even though it taught me great number of lessons. </p>\n<p>If you are wondering for the stats, Here they are with comparison:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>50+ users registered (Last was 40).</li>\n<li>Almost 4000+ views (Last was 2k).</li>\n<li>Content created 160+ times. (Last was 140)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The difference of 20 in content created is by me only, I guess.  </p>\n<p><strong>Would you call your product a success if you were the only user of it?</strong></p>\n<p>For me, I don't know but what I know is that putting more efforts into something which isn't giving me the results, not even close to what I expected, should be reconsidered. </p>\n<p>And that is why, I have added a timer in the bottom of Designtack, which clocks until the domain expires of Designtack, which is next month. The timer shows the only time I have got until I stop putting efforts in Designtack. It's a reminder. </p>\n<p>What I am going to do after it ends? I have a few ideas but let's see if they work out.</p>\n<p>That's it for this month. Tough times, for sure. My current focus will be the Newsletter, Psych. Also, To start brainstorming for the next adventure, for the month of September. </p>\n<p>Until next time.</p>","excerpt":"August has always been an intriguing month for me.
