Thinking and processing thoughts around only one thing. Messing about the one thing. My SaaS product.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Should I just wrap it all up and call it quits? I have tried for 5 years and nothing solid has happened. Maybe I have reached the peak already for Designtack?! My idea is worthless, why would someone even need a tool to create content in bulk? I am definitely overthinking. Am I? Not in this case. It's time I should stop this for once and all.</em></strong></p>\n<p>... and much more. We know how overthinking is like. How it boggles with our mind. </p>\n<p>But from all of this, there was one particular question whose answer I was looking for. As an independent makers, Maybe you can too resonate with this particular question.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you know if your project is a failure?</strong> </p>\n<p>For 5 years, I put everything into building Designtack to make it a dream agency. I was so dedicated that I even got 500+ visiting cards printed. Why not? I would've needed them for networking purposes. </p>\n<p>It didn't work out. I failed to build a team, failed to build relationships among clients to retain them, failed to achieve that \"dream agency\" goal.</p>\n<p>But did Designtack fail? I don't know.</p>\n<p>On 17th, The domain was set to expire for Designtack. I had no money to renew it and nor was the intention.</p>\n<p>But out of nowhere, \"the thing\" made me rethink everything. I talked to some people, I read about the concept of <strong><a href=\"https://baremetrics.com/blog/long-slow-saas-ramp-of-death\">Slow Saas Ramp of Death</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>I realised maybe I am judging it too early. This is a new journey of Designtack and it should be given some time. So, I throwed everything away from my mind and took the leap of faith.</p>\n<p>I renewed the domain and saved my first Saas from supposed death.</p>\n<p>I made new plans, revamped UI, made notes, made todo for notes, wrote ideas. This all was happening because of \"the thing\".</p>\n<p>So, I am very happy to tell you guys that <a href=\"https://www.designtack.com/\">Designtack</a> is alive and kicking it. I am giving my efforts to it with the new found, \"the thing\" for it.</p>\n<p>We almost have,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>69+ users registered (Last was 50).</li>\n<li>Almost 6,414+ views (Last was 4k).</li>\n<li>Content created 199+ times. (Last was 160)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Going rough but it's fine. I have a question, Do you think you can succeed if you continue working on it?</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I also have a Newsletter called <a href=\"http://psych.substack.com/\">Psych ðŸ§ </a>. With that, I recently crossed 100+ subscribers on it. Now, I will be diving deeper into it as well.</p>\n<p>Also, I was supposed to launch another project by the time I am writing this but Exams of University came up and I had to reschedule it. Not to be worried, I have it coming out very soon. Another product? Community? I will reveal it soon.</p>\n<p>That's the progress so far. Let's brace ourselves for another month, another set of goals that we have to reach.</p>\n<p>And yes, \"The thing\" I was talking about, it's called <strong>Hope</strong>. As a solopreneur, that's the only thing that keeps up going. </p>","excerpt":"Almost a month ago, My brain was brainstorming about only one thing.
