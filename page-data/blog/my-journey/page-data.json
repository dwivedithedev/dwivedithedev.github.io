I am from Delhi, India. I have a great passion of making and breaking things. Since childhood, I have been an absolute fan of technologies which progressed with time. This blog is about how It all started..</p>\n<h2>Story Time</h2>\n<p>I started programming, after I discovered this platform called, <a href=\"http://wapka.mobi\">Wapka</a> (anyone?). It was a place where you could create mobile sites, primarily using <strong>XML</strong>. Being curious, I explored XML and learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript. Thus, started my \"webmaster\" journey.</p>\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/VbnUQpnihPSIgIXuZv/giphy.webp\" alt=\"space cat aka most devs\"/>\n<h6>How most of the developers look like.</h6>\n</center>\n<p>Since then, I have been playing with Javascript and frameworks based on it. I have had my hands on with React, jQuery, Svelte etc. but most of the time, I am sticking with React. Thus, The categories or areas I have fiddled in include <a href=\"\">Cryptocurrency</a>, Augmented / <a href=\"\">Virtual Reality</a> and even <a href=\"\">Data science</a> (which is very interesting with Python!). </p>\n<p>While my interests are not limited to coding, they also include sketching characters, drawing things, reading books and learning something new!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe one should always be upto learning something as the compounding of knowledge helps you in various aspects of growing in life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love helping people and sharing my knowledge which sometimes, motivate others to reach their goals. I hope you will get to learn a couple of things from my journey and what I write here. You can message me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vaibhavthevedi\">twitter</a>. I would love to talk with you. </p>\n<h1>Bonus</h1>\n<p>You can join my email list to receive all the updates on what I am building, current book and more. Also, Because I am always upto learning, I would share things that I learn. For example, I am upto reading about Psychology these days and how we can utilise that to create better understanding towards things, mindset, perspective. Trust me, It is wonderful. I would love to share it with you and know your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Until then ðŸ‘‹.</p>\n<p>-VD</p>","excerpt":"Hello, there! My name is Vaibhav Dwivedi. I am from Delhi, India.
