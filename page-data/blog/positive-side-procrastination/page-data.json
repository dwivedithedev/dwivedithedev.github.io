What a difficult word to pronounce. It gives a weird vibe. Procrastination is often associated with \"bad habits\" or something which is not a good thing to do.</p>\n<p>But is it bad? Why is it termed a bad thing?</p>\n<p>Let us first talk about what is it, actually. As I do believe that the definition of Procrastination for you can differ than of mine. A simple google search gives me this answer:-</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Procrastination is the avoidance of doing a task that needs to be accomplished by a certain deadline. It could be further stated as a habitual or intentional delay of starting or finishing a task despite knowing it might have negative consequences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it is the <strong>Avoidance</strong> that takes place when we have to finish a task, or a job or anything which (may) has a deadline. Some sources even say that it is a mental illness at a certain extent. </p>\n<p>But I have this question, Why are we \"avoiding\" things in the first place? What led us to get distracted? What was the part that startled the procrastination zone?</p>\n<p>There could be a number of reasons around that. It may be that:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You received a Notification on your \"Smartphone\".</li>\n<li>Someone called you for a minor work and after doing that, you zoned out.</li>\n<li>There was an interesting link which took you to Twitter and then we all know what happened ü§∑‚Äç</li>\n<li>Your cute dog nudged you because it wants to go on a walk.</li>\n<li>Some XYZ reason.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First, You don't have to feel bad about it. It's okay, it happens to every one of us.</p>\n<p>Now, think about it. What made you give priority to this distraction over your primary work?</p>\n<p>If you notice, The point no. 4 in the list above is a bit different than the rest of the 3. You know, you might feel better after taking your dog for a walk! And that might help you solve that bug in your code. The repercussions are many.</p>\n<p>Here is an interesting fact.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did you know? Alexander Graham Bell refused to have a telephone in his study, fearing it would distract him from his scientific work. <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/alexander-graham-bell#section_3\">source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though he was the one who made it in the first place!</p>\n<p>My point is that Procrastination does not have to be taken as bad thing, all the time. I believe that <strong><em>Situation Matters</em></strong>, in almost all the cases.</p>\n<p>Let me explain what I mean by that. Do you know what Daydreaming means?</p>\n<p>Here is what our friends from Wikipedia says,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Daydreaming is the stream of consciousness that detaches from current external tasks when attention drifts to a more personal and internal direction. This phenomenon is common in people's daily life shown by a large-scale study in which participants spend 47% of their waking time on average on daydreaming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Isn't it somewhat similar to procrastination? As a kid, I used to daydream a lot. </p>\n<p>What did I dream about? You can guess it. Super fast cars, new computer games or meeting people in school (you know...).</p>\n<p>I, also, used to imagine how I will one day become this rich guy who will own a large property and have a big garage with top racing cars standing on the front. It sounds funny but I want to tell how I used to feel AFTER doing that. I felt all positive, motivated, just because I visualized it!</p>\n<p>That's what I want to highlight here. </p>\n<p>Visualizing your goals can help you get motivated and excited, bringing change in your mood. If you can acknowledge you are procrastinating at a given point of time, ask yourself. Is this really helping me at all? </p>\n<p>Acknowledging to yourself WHAT you are doing and WHY you are doing it, will help you get back to focus.</p>\n<p>Unless hours have passed ,it is almost evening, sun is down, then you should really STOP.</p>\n<h1>Update:-</h1>\n<p>Couple of things have happened since my last post. I will mention them in a list.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I completed my Certification in Social Psychology. üéâ I am glad I passed the exam. It was a wonderful course and I learned a lot. I will share with you all the awesome stuff in Psychology I have learned.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.designtack.com\">Designtack</a> is almost ready. I am quite nervous on how will the response be. It is my first Saas and I am looking forward it. </li>\n<li>The article I wrote on \"<a href=\"https://thevediwho.me/blog/the-power-of-not-knowing\">The power of not knowing</a>\" received a great response. I am thankful for all the positive comments!</li>\n<li>I closed my newsletter because it didn't go as planned. However, I will think about doing it again, in future.</li>\n<li>Lastly, If you love what I write here, I have added a button below to buymeacoffee page. It would mean a lot to me if you can help me afford a book / coffee. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thank you :)</p>","excerpt":"Procrastination. What a difficult word to pronounce. It gives a weird vibe.
