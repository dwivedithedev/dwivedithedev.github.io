Isn'tÂ itÂ bafflingÂ toÂ knowÂ thatÂ everyÂ dayÂ weÂ produceÂ soÂ muchÂ data,Â weÂ consumeÂ so muchÂ dataÂ thatÂ theÂ factÂ isÂ that entire digital universe is expected to reach

**44 zettabytes by 2020**, as mentioned on [weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/)

We, as humans, are creating so much data that *90% of world's data generated is done in last 2 years only!* It blows my mind. ğŸ¤¯ 

Â IÂ ponderÂ overÂ theÂ factÂ aÂ lotÂ thatÂ ifÂ weÂ areÂ creatingÂ soÂ muchÂ content,Â whereÂ isÂ itÂ even
Â going?Â onÂ theÂ web?Â inÂ theÂ computer?Â theÂ server? or our brains?Â AndÂ why?Â Won't it have impact on our brain? One way or another.

While I like statistics we have around data, I found that it changes almost every year. This means that the current rate of data generation per day will likely increase and be different in the next year. But hey, we are NOT here to talk about stats. 

What intrigued me is that how our lifestyle has been affected because of this rapid, mass data generation. Let's evaluate it with these questions. Ask yourself :-

1. What is the primary thing you do after you wake up?
2. Do you read a newspaper in the morning?
3. Do you have an information based app? Like Flipboard, WSJ or any news app. Do you use it?

Let's say you read in the newspaper a certain news. Then you see a notification about the same thing in your phone from the news app.

Now think about it. Are you **overloading** you brain with "data"? From my analysis, I realised I was reading news from newspaper as well as a news app. Not to mention, Twitter is there already for telling me "What's Happening". What I wonder is that if this somehow affects our mind? Change our perception towards things, perceptions, biases. 

The truth is, it certainly effects the biases and maybe perception as well. I have a recent example to share. 

*In a recent news, A bunch of boys were accused because they were trash-talking about a girl on a social media platform. The screenshot of the chat was shared by the girl on the internet and how she felt insecure. People started framing the boys for wrong intentions. In the screenshot, a guy was literally talking about potentially, abusing a girl. Everyone raged and this became a huge talk in the town. Later, Police took the case and arrested students who were linked with the same. After few days, In the police research it was found that the "guy" in the screenshot was actually a girl! She made a fake identity and was doing it to "verify" the trust between the boy and her.* 

Now, I have written very vague story here. Please keep that in mind. I want to tell you the consequences. On twitter, everyone bashed 'boys' in general regarding the same and influencers showed their concern for the girl. BUT, when the truth came out, A very few admitted they were wrong and showed the concern for the 'actual' victim.

Let's come back to data. Because of so many articles, print media that were made, people formed an opinion. It wasn't the same when the truth came out. Now, there is a lot of context I am missing out on here and by no mean, I am being biased for anyone. This is just to tell an example.

Large amount of data made people form an opinion towards only 1 aspect of the story. But most of them missed out on the other aspect, which was the actual truth. Do we have data to blame here? Or is it because of intentions of people?

This phenomenon is similar to *selective perception* in psychology. Thus, I made the following conclusions:-

# Takeaway

1. Always know the whole story. Have enough but CORRECT data.
2. There is a difference between Data and Information. Know it.
3. All data is NOT informational.

Do you have anything to add here? I would love to know your take on this. 

# Update

In my place, We had a crazy hailstorm last night and that led to internet downtime for more than 24 hours. As I write this, Internet is still gone. Let's hope for the best.
