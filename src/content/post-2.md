Hello, there! My name is Vaibhav Dwivedi. I am from Delhi, India. I have a great passion for making and breaking things. Since childhood, I have been an absolute fan of technologies which progressed with time. This blog is about how it all started...

##Story Time
I started programming after I discovered this platform called [Wapka](http://wapka.mobi) (anyone?). It was a place where you could create mobile sites, primarily using **XML**. Being curious, I explored XML and learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Thus began my journey as a "webmaster".

Since then, I have been playing with Javascript and frameworks based on it. I have hands-on experience with React, jQuery, Svelte, etc., but most of the time I stick with React. The categories or areas I have fiddled in include [Cryptocurrency](), Augmented / [Virtual Reality]() and even [Data science]() (which is very interesting with Python!). 

While my interests are not limited to coding, they also include sketching characters, drawing things, reading books and learning something new!

>I believe one should always be learning something as the compounding of knowledge helps you in various aspects of growing in life.

I love helping people and sharing my knowledge, which sometimes motivates others to reach their goals. I hope you will learn a few things from my journey and what I write here. You can message me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/vaibhavthevedi) - I would love to talk with you. 

#Bonus
You can join my email list to receive all the updates on what I am building, current book and more. Also, Because I am always into learning, I would share things that I learn. For example, I am reading about Psychology these days and how we can utilise that to create better understanding towards things, mindset, perspective. Trust me, It is wonderful. I would love to share it with you and know your thoughts.

Until then ðŸ‘‹.
